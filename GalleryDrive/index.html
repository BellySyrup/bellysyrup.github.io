	Latest version: 0.2

	Standalone:
	
	Gallery Drive requires only a google drive public folder id, found in the url of said folder.
	It then scans the folder for any files (only supports jpgs right now), and dumps them onto the screen in a container called galleryDrive.

	How this page works (WoW related)
	I use a World of Warcraft addon called Multishot that automatically takes screenshots of the game when important things happen,
	such as Level up, trades, achievements etc...

	These get saved in the Screenshots folder.
	I then used Belvedere, a desktop organization program to watch this folder and move all screenshots to my Public Google Drive folder called WoW.
	Then Gallery Drive does it's thing, and upchucks my screenshots onto the page, with a little demo styles thrown in to make it pretty.
	
	Supported file types:

		mp4, jpg, png

	All this from Screenshot to live on the web in ~4 seconds.

	Coming features:

		Watch multiple folders.
		More file type suppport (videos, sound, etc...)
		An app? who knows.
		Sign in with facebook or twitter (or google+) to like and comment? maybe
		templates in progress
