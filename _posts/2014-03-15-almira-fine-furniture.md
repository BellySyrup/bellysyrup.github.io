title: Almira Fine Furniture
description: Almira Furniture's legacy began as a family business in 1979, manufacturing and retailing superior quality, solid wood furniture. Our name, Almira, was inspired by the original location of our factory and showroom situated in the hamlet of Almira, just north of Unionville, in Markham, Ontario.
