I've finally gotten around to creating a new site. Hurrah for procrastination!! I can't believe it's been almost a full year since I left Hostgator after discovering Github pages, and I just NOW ... March 16th 2014, have completed a new site to the point where I've actually felt satisfied enough to make it live.

![oh yes...there will be LotR references](/img/blog/1.jpg)

Over the next few days I'll document the steps I went through to get the site to this point.

Some of the things I'll cover are:

- Design
- Coding Languages used
- Included libraries and plugins
- Troubleshooting
- Upcoming changes

Cheers,

Stephan
