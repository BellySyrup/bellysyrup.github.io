Well how about that? It's been a full year since I left Bykart Software / Durham College after working on Charm, an oncology appointment manager. Since I left they must have been featured in the Colleges Ontario Network for Industry Innovation 2012 - 2013 report. On page 19 of the report (21 of the pdf) you'll find a beautiful shot of our team (I'm in the stripped shirt, second from the left).
