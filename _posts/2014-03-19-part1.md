Part 1 of the Design, Development and Publishing process of the new site.
Basically the Who, Why, When, Where and How of web design. In this section I'll discuss the general ideas and goals for the new site.

## Part 1 - The Idea

![Loading... wait... Thinking...](https://googledrive.com/host/0BxjvFCbJpltvbDRyZUZZYXBCa2s/thought.jpg)

When I look around the internet I see quite a few new trends that I never really noticed before becoming a web developer. Keep in mind I graduated College 3 years ago come April, but I've been a long time Internet Enthusiast. Some things that pop out at me today are:

-	**Banners**. Everyone, or at least the majority (at least the majority... did that just happen?) has a nice, crisp banner image at the top of their page. It might be relative to their sites content, but the majority are just really pretty high-res images.
-	**Parallax**. The idea is to scroll the image, as you're scrolling the page, giving a static page more movement and animation. Pure eye candy, and it makes designers (and clients) cream their pants.
-	**Light**. White background, no borders and subtle background color changes from the body and footer. If you look at the footer at the bottom of the page, it goes from a #FFFFFF to #F0F0F0, not a HUGE difference, but when put side by side they still show a prominent content change, without overpowering the user with blasts of color.
-	**Animation**. No I'm not talking about Flash or Canvas. I'm talking about simple fading in and out of elements, especially when scrolling into view.
-	**Responsive**. When you look at major sites/apps such as facebook, and resize your screen, you'll notice it doesn't quite look right after a certain point. This is because it's not repsonsive. The idea what your site will rearrange itself regardless of what screen or device it's being used on. Back in the day developers would make a mobile version of a site, usually in the m.whatever.com subdomain. Nowadays we create responsive layouts that readjust without the need for seperate pages.

These 5 items are key to modern web design and development. If you don't have these, you're living in the dark ages of myspace.com, marquee tags and tables all over the place. My goal was to properly implement all 5 of these key roles into my site before I push it live.

I also had a few other requirements for my own benefit.

-	**Dynamic**. The site needs to be updateable without having to sift through source code, with the chance of breaking everything by accidentally deleting part of a tag. 
-	**Markdown**. On a similar note, Writers don't want to worry about formatting. They do not want to have to add header tags, or wrap each paragraph in p tags. They just want to write. Markdown takes the guess work out of page formatting.

All in all, I feel like I've created a site that no only captures todays modern design elements, but also valid coding techniques, ease of use, upgradability and last but definitely not least, a fast loading site that works on every device, in every browser (I'm looking at you Internet Explorer!).

Stay tuned for Part 2, where I'll talk about tools, languages and techniques used.

Cheers!
