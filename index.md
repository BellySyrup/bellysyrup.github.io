I am a Digital Developer, currently working remotely for [Innovasium Digital](http://www.innovasium.com/). I mainly work with HTML, CSS and Javascript (jQuery and Angularjs), as well as Cold Fusion, PHP, SQL, XML, LUA and Java. I sometimes post stuff on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/sconzen) and [Medium](http://www.medium.com/@sconzen) for anything longer than 140 characters.
